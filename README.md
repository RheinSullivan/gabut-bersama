Use this website wisely, my friends...

This website was created with the help of the css framework, to run it you must install the NodeJs application, and the help of the Gitbash application.

# Run this command:
npm install -D tailwindcss => 
npx tailwindcss init => 
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/main.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

or you can check on the Tailwindcss website, only the command to run it is different, because the placement of the main/input.css file is different from the default Tailwindcss.
